Some **key characteristics of the lanternfish**:
- Surely, each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish once every 7 days.
- Model each fish as a single number that represents the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish.
- **input**: several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input)
- Each day, a 0 becomes a 6 and adds a new 8 to the end of the list
- also each day: each other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of the day.
